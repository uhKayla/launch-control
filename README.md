# Launch Control

Launch control is a SvelteKit + Tauri app for controlling Space Engineers Torch servers via Torch Remote. 

This project is very incomplete, and was created for me to learn the basics of Tauri, SvelteKit, and Typescript. Please do not expect it to be top-notch, or a good example of a proper Tauri application.

### Prerequisites
Please be sure to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and follow the [Tauri setup guide](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites).

*I am not a Tauri / Rust expert by any means, you may be on your own for this one.

### To Run

```bash
cargo tauri dev
```

### To Build
```bash
cargo tauri build
```
